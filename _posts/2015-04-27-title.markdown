After welcoming Robert Clifton, our latest newcomer, Graham proceeded to make a presentation on the topic of 'Perspective' - it's properties, uses and abuses. Included in the presentation was the idea of single and double vanishing points. A multi-page handout was given to everyone in attandance. It was also stated that this topic is covered by several 'YouTube' video's. Anyone wanting to see any of the 'YouTube' presentation should load 'YouTube' then search for the topic they require.

This month we had two competitions which produced a wide variation of interpretations from wild life to still life and abstractions.

The winners were:-
<ul>
	<li>1st - 'Spotty's My Name - Linda Evans</li>
	<li>2nd - 'Simply Knocking Spots Off' - Lisa Grace</li>
	<li>3rd - 'Night Light' - Tony Grevett</li>
</ul>
