For a change the June meeting was held away from Broseley Library. Attending memberts met near the lakeside fo Southwater at 19:15. Though we had a disappointing turnout the evening remained warm and dry so several photographs could be taken of the local architecture, wildfowl and other attractions of the area, and enjoyed by all who came along.

The ‘Monthly Competition’ entitled ‘Four Legs’ was held.

The winners were:-
<ul>
	<li>1st - 'Now I'm in Trouble' - Linda Evans</li>
	<li>2nd - 'He's Gone looking for the Rainbow' - John Horton</li>
	<li>3rd - 'Rain drops aren't falling on my head' - John Horton</li>
</ul>
