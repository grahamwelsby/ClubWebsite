<br/>
Broseley Camera Club is a small informal group of like minded people who meet once a month to discuss and display their photographs and share experiences.  There is no membership fee, but members are asked to pay Â£1.50 each at meetings which they do attend, to defray room hire costs.

The club offers a warm welcome to photographers of all abilities, from complete beginners to the experienced, the club offers something for everyone. The 'focus' of the club is to help members improve and enjoy all aspects of photography with advice freely offered. 
 
Monthly sessions are made up of Workshops and Focus points. These consist of presentations of varied subjects and techniques from the world of photography. Competitions are held monthly and quarterly, judged by other attending members. The aim for the competitions are to encourage members to 'go out and shoot', keeping fresh the discussed presentations and newly acquired skills
  
The Club usually meets on the last Monday of each month, at 7:30pm in Broseley Library, Bridgnorth Road, Broseley. Click <a href="{{ site.url }}/programme/">HERE</a> to see what we are doing this year.
